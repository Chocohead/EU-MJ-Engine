# MAY APEAR BUGS BECAUSE IM NOT MODDER ACTUALLY. IF YOU FOUND BUG - TELL ME!

## EU-MJ Engine

* Adds 5 different EU consuming engines for producing [BuildCraft's](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft) MJ.
* Adds a WIP MJ-Reader for measuring the MJ flow in pipes.
* Allows the guide book to have it's contents reloaded once the game has started using `F3-T`.

Currently a proof of concept, engines currently produce a static amount of MJ as soon as they have enough EU for it, which might not be the final mechanic.
A way of producing EU back from MJ could be nice too.
